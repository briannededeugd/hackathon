## Introduction to the assignment

On 25/03, we were introduced to Krijn Hoetmer who presented to us the assignment for this Hackathon. There are no rules, we may use whatever we please, so long as we create something awesome using data detailing every year of CSS Day, which he has put together for us to use.

Whoever wins, gets tickets to CSS Day. So.. for a lot of us, the challenge was on.

## Installation

Here are the steps to install our project.

1. Under the `Code` tab at the top.
2. Download this repository as a `.zip` file and unpack it.
3. Locate the folder `hackathon`
    - If you have `VS Code`: From here, all you need to do is open the folder in your editor and use the `Live Server` extension to start a local host. This allows you to also view the code and work more hands-on, should you desire.
    - If not, you can find the document on your device, navigate to the `index.html` file (this should be visible just by opening up `hackathon`), right-click it and open in a browser of your choosing.
